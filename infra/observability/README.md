# Observability

## Responsibility

This module defines logging, metrics, and tracing strategy for the agent. It provides visibility into agent behavior, performance, and health in production.

## Key Concepts

- **Logging**: Structured logs for debugging and auditing
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements (latency, throughput, errors)
- **Tracing**: Distributed traces across service boundaries
- **Alerting**: Automated alerting based on thresholds

## Responsibilities

- Implement structured logging with contextual information
- Define key metrics for monitoring
- Support distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry)
- Provide dashboard definitions for visualization
- Define alerting rules and thresholds
- Support log aggregation and querying
- Enable real-time monitoring of agent behavior
- Provide performance profiling capabilities
