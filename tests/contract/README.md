# Contract Tests

## Responsibility

This directory contains contract tests that validate interfaces and contracts between components. Contract tests ensure that components can safely interact with each other.

## Key Concepts

- **Interface Contracts**: Validate that components implement required interfaces
- **Data Contracts**: Verify data format and schema compliance
- **Behavioral Contracts**: Test expected behavior at component boundaries
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing contracts

## Responsibilities

- Define and validate component contracts
- Test tool interfaces with mocked providers
- Verify service interface compliance
- Validate state serialization contracts
- Test message format contracts (WhatsApp API)
- Support contract-driven development
- Document breaking changes
