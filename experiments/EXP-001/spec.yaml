# EXP-001: Baseline Phi Behavior (No Memory, No Tools)
# 
# Objective: Measure observed behavior of Phi model under default conditions
# to establish baseline for future experiments.
#
# This is a MEASUREMENT-ONLY experiment. No fixes, tuning, or improvements.
# All behavior is observed and classified, not changed.

experiment_id: "EXP-001"

# Hypothesis is descriptive, not prescriptive
hypothesis: "Phi model will exhibit deterministic behavior on factual questions
  and timeouts on open-ended prompts due to inherent model capability limits,
  not architectural defects. This experiment measures these limits without
  attempting to mitigate them."

# No independent variable - this is baseline measurement
changed_variable: "NONE"

# Reference to Phase 5.2 baseline
baseline_id: "baseline-phi-default"

# Label for this variant (no changes, just measurement)
variant_id: "default-no-modifications"

# Metrics from Phase 5.2 evaluation pipeline
# These are observational metrics, not targets to optimize
