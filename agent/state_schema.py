Agent state schema and types.

The AgentState is the single source of truth for all agent execution context.
It is mutated only by specific nodes and never by task execution.

Phase 2 Addition: Memory-related fields store pointers and flags, never knowledge.
Phase MCP Addition: Tool execution fields track tool calls and results per turn.
